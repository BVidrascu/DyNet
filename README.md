# DyNet

**DyNet** is a template for creating dynamic social network visualizations. Built on a simple JavaScript framework, it enables you to design and animate social networks with ease.

## Features

- **Custom Node Layout**  
  Arrange nodes in any desired layout and assign them various colors.

- **Animated Edge Formation**  
  Create links between nodes with smooth animations that depict the formation of relationships.

- **Node Color Change Animation**  
  Animate node color transitions to reflect status changes or group shifts.

- **Edge Deletion Animation**  
  Watch edges shake and fade away as they are removed from the network.

## Event-Driven Animations

Each animation corresponds to a single event step. The framework supports:

- Starting and stopping the animation.
- Stepping through events one at a time.
- Viewing a dynamic timeline of events.
- Adjusting the speed of the animations via a slider.

# DyNet complex network

A more complex variant of the dynamic network. Edge and node generation is handled differently. It makes more sense for larger networks that just tell one big story.
